   What is stack ?
   Stack is a Data Structure which uses LIFO(Last In First Out)
   principle.
   You can insert and delete element from the same end.
   This is know as TOP.


   Let's consider a stack of clothes. The cloth you stakced on
   the top is the last cloth. Now When you want a cloth, the
   cloth you inserted at last will come out first. 
   This is LIFO.
   You might ask yourself how to access my favourite shirt which
   is in between the clothes stack ?
   Thats the NEAT part you can't.
   You can only insert at the top and remove from the top.
   
   Stacks can be implemented with 
   1. Arrays
   2. LinkedLists

   I will implement stack with arrays as well as linkedList.
   Time and Space complexity: O(1)(insertion and deletion)
   and O(1)
