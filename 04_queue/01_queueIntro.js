  What is Queue ?
  
  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word queue ? 
  Queue at the airport, bookshop, queue for movie tickets...
  In a queue, the first person to move in is the first person to move out.
  
  Similarly Queue data structure works on the principle
  of FIFO(First In First Out).

  Real life examples of Queue
  1. while listening to Songs, you click "add songs to the queue". The songs
      added first to the queue are played first.
  2. Queue at the theatre, person who came in first came out first.
  

  In stacks we push & pop elements from the same end.
  However, in a queue we push elements to rear and pop elements from
  the top/front. 

  Time Complexity: Insertion O(1) and Deletion O(1)
  Space Complexity: O(n)
