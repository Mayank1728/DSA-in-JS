  What is Queue ?
  
  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word queue ? 
  Queue at the airport, bookshop, queue for movie tickets...
  In a queue, the first person to move in is the first person to move out.
  
  Similarly Queue data structure works on the principle
  of FIFO(First In First Out).

  In stacks we push & pop elements from the same end.
  However, in a queue we push elements to rear and pop elements from
  the top/front. 

  Time Complexity: Insertion O(1) and Deletion O(1)
  Space Complexity: O(n) as you can access elements from the top ONLY.
