           Binary Trees
   
    1. Difference between linear and non linear data structure

        Linear data structure like arrays, linkedList, stack and queues are data
        is stored in SEQUENTIAL manner (one after the another)
        
        Trees are non-linear data structure which means data is stored NON-SEQUENTIALLY.
        Trees contains levels.
    
    2. A tree contains ONLY 1 ROOT NODE. A node can reference(point towards : ->)
        ONLY to children nodes. Furthermore, a node CANNOT reference(point towards : ->)
        back to parent node or to its sibling node. 

    
    Terminology:
        root node: first/top most node of a tree
        leaf: node with no children
        sibling: nodes with same parent
        edge: connection b/w 2 nodes


    Real World Examples:
    1. files directory
    2. html dom
    3. AI (ex- minimax tree): playing against itself what happens next
    4. JSON: javascript object notation

    Types of trees
    1. binary tree
    2. binary Search tree
    3. AVL etc
